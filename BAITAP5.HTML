    <h3>5. Groups of selectors</h3>
    <div>
        A comma-separated list of selectors represents the union of all elements selected by each of the individual
        selectors in the list. (A comma is U+002C.) For example, in CSS when several selectors share the same
        declarations, they may be grouped into a comma-separated list. White space may appear before and/or after the
        comma.
    </div>
    <br>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td class="backgrout">CSS example: <br>
                In this example, we condense three rules with identical declarations into one. Thus, <br>
                <br>h1 { font-family: sans-serif } <br>
                h2 { font-family: sans-serif } <br>
                h3 { font-family: sans-serif} <br>
                <br>is equivalent to: <br>
                <br>h1, h2, h3 { font-family: sans-serif}
            </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
